Hi, i'm a 21 year old computer science student living in Austria. Since I'm working part time as a webdeveloper, I am mostly occupied by university stuff and work during my semester. I mostly use *Java* for my projects since it is the language needed for most of my university assingments, but due to work, I started to learn *Typescript* and i konw some C#.

## Fields im interested in: 
- Cybersecurity (mainly through CTFs)
- Digital audio processing 

## Current projects:
- currently none
