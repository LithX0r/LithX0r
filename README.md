Hi, I'm a 23-year-old computer science and math student living in Austria. Since I'm working part-time as a web developer, I am mostly occupied by university stuff and work during my semester. I mostly use *Java* for my projects since it is the language needed for most of my university assignments, but due to work, I started to learn *Typescript* and *C#*.

## Fields I'm interested in: 
- Cybersecurity (mainly through CTFs)
- Digital audio processing
- Wireless transmission

## Current projects:
- currently none
