Hi, i'm a 20 year old computer science student living in Austria. I'm currently occupied with stuff from university but maybe i'll get some projects done during hollidays. I mostly use *Java* for my projects since it is the language needed for most of my university assingments, but i also know some *C#*.

## Fields im interested in: 
- Cybersecurity (mainly through CTFs)
- Digital audio processing 

## Current projects:
- Advent of Code
